        <h2>The CrowdStrike Outage: What Happened?</h2>
        <p>
            In July 2024, a routine update to the CrowdStrike Falcon sensor caused a massive IT outage. The update included a new configuration that required 21 input parameters. Unfortunately, the system was only prepared to handle 20 inputs, leading to a critical mismatch. This error caused millions of devices to crash, disrupting services in hospitals, airlines, and other critical sectors worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
            CrowdStrike's swift response included rolling out patches, but the damage had already been done. This incident highlighted the risks associated with software updates, especially in high-stakes environments.

            Our Real-Time Security Update Validation and Rollback System was created to prevent such incidents. It validates updates in a sandbox environment, predicts potential issues using AI, and rolls back updates automatically if any problems are detected. Below is a demonstration of how our system works.
